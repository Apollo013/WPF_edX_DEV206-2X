 Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) is a declarative XML-based markup language that allows for the design-time definition of an applicationâ€™s UI. XAML simplifies the creation of rich user interfaces by separating the development and design elements of the application. In this course, you will learn:

        How to create new XAML components including: Dependency Properties, Attached Properties, Custom Controls and Control Templates. 
        Using templates to alter the look and feel of a XAML control-button. 
        Using Styles to re-use design components throughout a XAML application 
        Using Behaviors and TypeConverters to create composable pieces of user interface logic that can be reused across multiple XAML applications.
        How to create dynamic interfaces using Animations and Storyboards. 
        Using Triggers, Commands and Routed Events in your application. 
        Implement the Model-View-View-Model pattern.
